"""Domain errors -- the framework-free vocabulary the layers below HTTP raise.

domain/, services/, db/ and agents/ must not know that HTTP exists, so they raise these
instead of fastapi.HTTPException. api/routes/ (plus the handlers in main.py) is the ONE
place that decides which status code each one becomes.

That is what keeps those layers callable from somewhere other than a web request -- the
reaper's background sweep, a CLI script, a unit test -- with no FastAPI involved.

    Raised only by ChatService.continue_chat, wrapping whatever went wrong. It carries
    the stage the conversation is ACTUALLY still at, because the HTTP layer cannot know
    it -- the failure happened before a stage could be returned.

    Why that matters: without it the response said done=True / stage=DONE, so the
    frontend reset a perfectly good conversation over one transient agent timeout. The
    user then re-described the problem from scratch and we opened a SECOND ServiceNow
    incident. With the real stage and done=False they simply resend the same message.

    `incident_id` is set when a ServiceNow ticket was already raised before the failure.
    That changes what we tell the user: instead of "please try again" -- which makes them
    start over and open a SECOND ticket -- we hand them the number that already exists
    and tell them not to. Removing the reason to retry is what prevents the duplicate.

    The original cause is preserved on __cause__ (raised with `from`), so the log line
    still shows what actually broke.
