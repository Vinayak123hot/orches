"""Support-flow engine: the stage machine, as a class over its injected agents.

SupportFlow.step() advances a conversation by one turn and returns
(messages, new_stage, flow_vars). It holds no per-conversation state -- the caller owns
`stage` and `flow_vars` and passes them in every turn -- so a single instance is safe to
share across requests and the handlers stay pure functions of their arguments.

What it holds instead is its collaborators: one object per agent (see agents/), injected
in __init__. That is the reason this is a class rather than a module of functions.
Previously the handlers imported `run_agent_json`, `snow_create_incident` and friends
directly at module scope, which meant the only way to test a stage was to monkeypatch
module globals. Now a test constructs SupportFlow with a stub per agent and drives any
branch with no network at all.

EACH AGENT IS AN OBJECT WITH ITS OWN METHOD -- self._orchestrator.classify(...), not
call_json(conv_id, <which agent>, ...). The agents used to be Function Apps behind URLs,
so one generic client was told which one to POST to on every call; now the agent is the
object and only the DATA is passed. A stage cannot call the wrong agent by passing the
wrong URL, and what each agent needs is visible in its own signature.

Still framework-agnostic: no FastAPI objects, no DB access, no HTTP status codes. It
raises ConversationEnded (see core/errors.py); the api layer decides that means 409.

# NOTE ON DUPLICATE TICKETS -- why there is no correlation_id here.
#
# A key derived from user_id + the message (stable across a retry) was built and then
# removed on purpose. It only pays off if ServiceNow matches OPEN incidents only:
#
#   same complaint while the old ticket is open   -> reuse is reasonable
#   same complaint after the old one was closed   -> MUST create a new ticket
#
# Get that second rule wrong and a user's new problem is attached to a closed ticket
# nobody is working -- their issue silently disappears. A wrong merge is worse than the
# duplicate it prevents, so the field is not sent until ServiceNow can guarantee the
# scoping.
#
# What replaces it: api/routes/ no longer tells a user to "try again" once a ticket exists
# -- it hands them the incident number and says they need not start over. That removes
# the retry we were causing, which was the main source of duplicates. The cases still
# uncovered are a user ignoring that message, and double-submits (two tabs / double
# click) -- the latter produces duplicates even when nothing fails, and only a
# ServiceNow-side key could catch it.
