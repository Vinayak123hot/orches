"""Create the local SQLite tables for offline testing.

Run once, FROM THE PROJECT ROOT so that `app` is importable:

    python scripts/setup_sqlite.py

Then set SQLITE_DB_PATH=local.db in your .env and run the app; it will use SQLite
instead of Azure SQL. Delete local.db anytime to start fresh.

The schema is IMPORTED from app.db.database rather than copied here. It used to be
duplicated, and the copy had already drifted (it was missing job_baseline). One
definition means the tables this script creates are always the ones the app expects.

Note the app also creates these tables on first connect, so running this is optional --
it's here for when you want a database file ready before starting anything.
